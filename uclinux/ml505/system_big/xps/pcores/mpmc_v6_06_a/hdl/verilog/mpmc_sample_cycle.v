// mpmc_sample_cycle.v - Clock Ratio and Phase detection Logic
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Filename:          mpmc_sample_cycle.v
// Description:
//       This sample cycle generator counts the number of clock edges
//       of the fast_clk in two slow_clk cycles and uses half of that as
//       the slow_clk/fast_clk ratio to generate the slow_clk sample cycle
//       signal in the next two slow_clk cycles. This scheme is used mainly to
//       provide a robust mechanism to accomocate for a 1:1 ratio between
//       slow_clk and fast_clks. The sample cycle signal is aligned to the
//       rising edge of the fast clock and is asserted for 1 fast_clk in the
//       cycle prior to the rising edge of slow_clk.
